# Subnet
Subnetwork extraction tool for brain connectome studies
This include a user-friendly GUI to import data such as -logp adjacency matrix, you can use the too in three ways:
1. Install the MATLAB package using Subnet/Subnet.mlappinstall
2. Install the standalone windows executive file using app1/for_redistribution/Subnet.exe (MATLAB Runtime required to install)
3. Directly open app.mlapp in MATLAB
